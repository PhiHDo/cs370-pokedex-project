        <p>The Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet games, developed by GAME FREAK, 
            are the newest chapters in the Pokémon RPG series for the Nintendo 
            Switch system. In these games, the Pokémon series takes a new 
            evolutionary step, allowing you to explore freely in a richly expressed
             open world. <br/></p> 
             <p>Various towns blend seamlessly into the wilderness 
             with no borders. You'll be able to see the Pokémon of this region in the
              skies, in the seas, in the forests, on the streets—all over! You'll be 
              able to experience the true joy of the Pokémon series—battling against 
              wild Pokémon in order to catch them—now in an open-world game that 
              players of any age can enjoy. <br/></p> 
              <p>There are three Pokémon from which 
              you'll be able to choose your first partner. There's Sprigatito, the 
              Grass Cat Pokémon; Fuecoco, the Fire Croc Pokémon; and Quaxly, the 
              Duckling Pokémon. How will you meet these three, and what sorts of 
              Pokémon are they? <br/><p>
                  As one of the main characters, you'll set off 
              on your adventure. Your outfit will vary depending on whether you 
              play Pokémon Scarlet or Pokémon Violet. Find out what kind of story 
              awaits you!
